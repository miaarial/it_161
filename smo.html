<h2 class="subheader">Social Media Optimization</h2>
 <p>&emsp;“Social media optimization (SMO) is the process of increasing awareness of a product, brand, or event on social media.” (Norton). A business’s goal will always be growth, and creating a website is the most obvious way to begin and continue to develop on that journey. Our job as web developers is to cater to a business’ needs, which includes keeping up to date with the latest tactics to increase website traffic. More and more the world leans into social media and leans away from simple Google searches. Where people may have spent a lot of time on different blogs and web pages in the past, the average user now spends more of their time online on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and other websites of that nature. <br>A main web page needs shares, likes, and retweets from outside sources to be relevant, not only to users but increasingly also to search engines.</p>
    
 <p>&emsp;What does that mean for websites and the people that build them? Well, it means we adapt and overcome. Where Search Engine Optimization (SEO) started, SMO has been able to take off. SMO is unpaid tactics that organically bring in more consumers and users, similar to SEO. However, SEO tactics focus on appealing to the underbelly of the internet; SEO wants to impress the robots that Google sets out to grab relevant content. SMO puts the focus back on impressing the user by getting down to their level and what draws real people’s attention. </p>
    
 <p>&emsp;Ideally, SMO will be able to pick up SEO’s slack, though it is still a good idea to have a firm grasp on utilizing both sets of tools. They also work very closely together. </p>
    
 <p>&emsp;To use SMO well, first the business and website need a coherent strategy. Steps like creating clear goals, identifying which networks and websites will help attain those goals efficiently, creating engaging content and genuinely engaging with users, and continuing to track, develop, and improve your strategies will make a huge difference in the world of social media where the trends are always changing. </p>
    
 <p>&emsp;Strategizing and planning content that is appealing to a business’ and website’s users takes time, but is worth the effort. One overarching goal is to bring in new users that have never heard of the business before. Tools like keywords and hashtags take research to identify but make all the difference. Additionally, researching the best times to post for not only the social media platform being used but also for the business’ audience makes it more likely that important content will be seen by the right people. Finally, keeping track and learning from your own trends on social media and your main website will drive home these techniques and make them a continual learning experience. </p>
    
 <p>&emsp;SMO is just one piece of the web development puzzle, but developing a space that is not only usable but also engaging, is what will keep regulars coming back, as well as bring new users to the platform.</p>
